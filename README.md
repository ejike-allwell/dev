## My process 
I created a different folder for this solution. Inside this folder i initialized a git repositiory, created a HTML, and CSS files, and i staged and commit these newly created files.

I continued by marking out my basic website structure that has the image, the header and the paragraph all in inside a div container, and staged and commited these modifications.

After the successfull creation and basic structuring, i proceeded to first making styles for mobile and staged and commited these changes, then making styles for desktop view and staged and commited these procedures.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vscode
- Mobile preview(an extension in vs code)
